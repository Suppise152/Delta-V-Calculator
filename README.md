How to Use this Site
        This is an interactive ΔV map. Simply click on a node on a branch to determine the target planet, and how you would like to explore it. Toggle the checkboxes to tweak the calculations to your mission parameters, and watch the required ΔV values as well as the relevant transfer angles be displayed in real time.
    
Using a Delta-V Map
        To use a typical ΔV map, you add all the values along the branch, from your starting position to your target position. A white arrow in the direction of your travel means you can aerobrake there and can therefore exclude the value from your calculation. The values above a branch indicate plane changes. This site performs all these calculations for you.
    
What is Delta-V (ΔV)
        Delta-V, or ΔV, can be interpreted as the range of a given craft. Similar to how a car may say it has 50 km of fuel left, a spacecraft may have 5000 m/s of ΔV left. Performing maneuvers such as changing your orbit or landing on a planet will use up some of your ΔV. Knowing how much ΔV is required to perform a given task is essential for planning any mission.
